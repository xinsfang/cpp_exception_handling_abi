cpp_exception_handling_abi
==========================

A mini ABI capable of handling throw/catch statements for C++ without libstdc++

The goal of this project is not replacing libstdc++ but only to learn a bit about how exceptions are handled from a low-level C++ perspective.

This is the code repository for an article that can be found at http://monoinfinito.wordpress.com/series/exception-handling-in-c/
